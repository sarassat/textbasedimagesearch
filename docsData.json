          "description": "This Python script implements a small Streamlit application for retrieving images based on textual descriptions. It loads a CSV file containing image paths, captions and pre\u2011computed caption embeddings, hides the Streamlit menu using CSS and displays a logo and header. The script defines several helper functions and uses OpenAI\u2019s embedding API to convert user queries into vector representations. After computing similarity scores between the query embedding and caption embeddings stored in the data frame, it returns the top N most similar images and displays them on the page\u3010535248545258629\u2020L18-L74\u3011.",
          "apiDetails": "**Functions defined in this file:**\n\n* `convert_to_float(lst)`: Converts a textual representation of a list into a list of floats using `ast.literal_eval`\u3010535248545258629\u2020L24-L27\u3011.\n* `get_embedding(text)`: Uses the OpenAI API to create an embedding for the supplied text using the `text\u2011embedding\u2011ada\u2011002` model\u3010535248545258629\u2020L31-L37\u3011. A 1.1\u2011second delay is added after the API call to avoid hitting rate limits. Returns the embedding vector.\n* `vector_similarity(vec1, vec2)`: Computes the dot product between two vectors using NumPy\u3010535248545258629\u2020L39-L41\u3011.\n* `search_image(images_df, user_input, n=5)`: Computes a query embedding for the user input, uses `vector_similarity` to compute similarity scores between each caption embedding in the data frame and the query embedding, sorts the results by similarity and returns the top `n` rows\u3010535248545258629\u2020L43-L50\u3011.\n* `image_retrieval(user_input='None')`: Calls `search_image` and extracts the `imagePath` column to produce a list of image paths\u3010535248545258629\u2020L51-L56\u3011.\n\nThe application also registers a Streamlit form that accepts a text input and, upon submission, retrieves and displays the top five matching images\u3010535248545258629\u2020L58-L74\u3011.",
          "performanceRecommendations": "* **Externalise the API key:** The OpenAI API key is hard coded in the script. Reading it from an environment variable (e.g. via `os.environ.get('OPENAI_API_KEY')`) will make deployments safer and prevent unnecessary rebuilds when the key changes.\n* **Vectorise similarity computation:** Computing dot products in a loop can be slow for large data sets. Consider storing caption embeddings in a NumPy matrix and performing a single matrix\u2013vector multiplication to obtain similarity scores instead of using `DataFrame.apply`.\n* **Cache API responses more aggressively:** OpenAI API calls are rate limited. The script already uses Streamlit\u2019s `@st.cache_data` decorator, but additional caching of query embeddings or results can reduce repeated calls when users submit the same query.\n* **Avoid reading CSV at module import time:** Reading the CSV and initialising the API key at the top level means the file is loaded and the API key is set on every import. Wrapping these operations inside a function or under a `if __name__ == '__main__'` guard makes the module more flexible for reuse.\n* **Remove unused imports:** `matplotlib.pyplot as plt` is imported but not used in the script; removing unused imports reduces memory footprint and speeds up load time.\n* **Use vectorised conversion:** The `convert_to_float` helper applies `float()` to each element of the caption embedding string. Using NumPy\u2019s `np.fromstring` or list comprehension after splitting on commas could improve performance.\n",
          "vulnerabilities": "* **Hard\u2011coded secrets:** The OpenAI API key is stored directly in the source code\u3010535248545258629\u2020L18-L21\u3011. Anyone with access to the repository can see and misuse it. Read the key from a secure environment variable instead.\n* **Inadequate error handling:** The `try/except` around the form submission swallows all exceptions without logging, which makes debugging difficult. Logging specific exceptions and providing user\u2011friendly error messages would help maintainers identify issues.\n* **Resource exhaustion risk:** The script opens images in a loop and keeps them in a list. If a user requests many images or if `n` is increased, this could exhaust memory. Consider streaming images or limiting the number of images displayed.\n* **Potential injection through `ast.literal_eval`:** Although `ast.literal_eval` is safer than `eval`, parsing untrusted strings could still throw errors or be exploited if the CSV is compromised. Validate inputs and handle exceptions properly.\n"
